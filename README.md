## Assignment Description
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to collect data on the health and nutritional status of the United States population. It contains demographic, dietary, examination, laboratory, and questionnaire data of adults and children. The NHANES 2021-2023 dataset is used in this assignment to perform basic inferential statistics.

### Question 1 (Chi-square): "Is there an association between marital status (married or not married) and education level (bachelor’s degree or higher vs. less than a bachelor’s degree)?"
- *Analysis Result*: There is a significant association between marital status and education level. The p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, thus indicating that the relationship between the two variables is statistically meaningful.

### Question 2 (T-test): "Is there a difference in the mean sedentary behavior time between those who are married and those who are not married?"
- *Analysis Result*: There is no significant difference between mean sedentary behavior time and marital status. The p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, thus indicating that they have no statistically meaningful difference between the two variables.

### Question 3 (Regression): "How do age and marital status affect systolic blood pressure?"
- *Analysis Result*: Marital status and age have a significant affect on systolic blood pressure. The p-value for the independent variables of marital status and age are less than the significance level of 0.05, thus indicating that they have a statistically meaningful affect on systolic blood pressure.
  
### Question 4 (Correlation): "Is there a correlation between self-reported weight and minutes of sedentary behavior?"
- *Analysis Result*: There is a significant correlation between self-reported weight and sedentary behavior time. The p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, thus indicating that there is a statistically meaningful correlation between the two variables.
  
### Question 5 (Creative Analysis): "Is there a difference in mean sedentary behavior time between kidney status (being told of having a weak/failing kidneys vs. not being told of having a weak/failing kidneys)?"
- I chose to perform a 1-way ANOVA test to measure the difference in mean sedentary behavior time across the two groups for kidney status. Comparing these two variables interested me because studies support that sedentary behavior may be a risk factor for chronic kidney disease.
- *Analysis Result*: There is no significant difference in the mean sedentary behavior time between being told of having weak/failing kidneys and not told of having weak/failing kidneys. The p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, thus indicating that there is no statistically meaningful difference between the two variables.
